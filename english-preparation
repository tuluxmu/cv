***************************

I  really apreciate with my leader in Meiyou company .
He taught me a lot . He told me that Only if I become a person who have unique skills and high efficiency of solving problems , I can live better .
I also make a lot of good friends in Meiyou .
This is what i really appreciate.

****************************
The master library I use is Jquery and Zepto.
In my leasure time , I learn React and Nodejs.
As for me, React is different with other Librarys.
In MVC model, React just stands for View.
And it includes the virtual DOM, which  it improve the speed of Render Browsery.
the Most important point in React is you must know about Props and State.
React defines Props is unchangabel attribute and State is changable.
If you want to change some datas or something, you can use state to bind with some events.
and you can use Props to expose some attributes to the Parenet Element .

I learn NODEJS by myself. I try to build A blog .
And in blog system , I know what I shoud do to operate a data ,like add delete change or find it.
and I can better know how the back end engineer  transelate data to me.

As far as I am concerned , A front end engineer is a person who connects PM , Backend engineer and Users.
How to presents a beautiful page is the front end engineer's main job.
A good front end engineer not only concerns about  the way of represent ,but also concerns about how to pretty the website to make it more quick and  more efficiency.

My workflow in Meetyou is that the PM write requirement documents and we talk about if the case is stable and if the case can be excuted . and evaluate the day of finishing the task.
And then the UI designer will draw the PSD , and I will talk with back end engineer the structure of data that they transfer to me.
And I will start to develop.

What I learn in MeiYou is that I can solve a problem bymyself.
Maybe in the colleage, when i meet with a problem ,the first thing i do is ask someone for help .
But now ,I can solve a problem by console.log or debugger .
And my way of programming is from process-oriented to object-oriented.
And I love the process of solving a problem and it makes me be proud of myself.

I really want to be a part of your campany , and If you hire me , i will never make you disapointed.
