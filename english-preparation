what the main job in MeiYou is to :

***********************************************************
***************************

I  really apreciate with my leader in Meiyou company .
He taught me a lot . He told me that Only if I become a person who have unique skills and high efficiency of solving problems , I can live better .
I also make a lot of good friends in Meiyou .
This is what i really appreciate.

****************************
The master library I use is Jquery and Zepto.
In my leasure time , I learn React and Nodejs.
As for me, React is different with other Librarys.
In MVC model, React just stands for View.
And it includes the virtual DOM, which  it improve the speed of Render Browsery.
the Most important point in React is you must know about Props and State.
React defines Props is unchangabel attribute and State is changable.
If you want to change some datas or something, you can use state to bind with some events.
and you can use Props to expose some attributes to the Parenet Element .

I learn NODEJS by myself. I try to build A blog .
And in blog system , I know what I shoud do to operate a data ,like add delete change or find it.
and I can better know how the back end engineer  transelate data to me.

As far as I am concerned , A front end engineer is a person who connects PM , Backend engineer and Users.
How to presents a beautiful page is the front end engineer's main job.
A good front end engineer not only concerns about  the way of represent ,but also concerns about how to pretty the website to make it more quick and  more efficiency.

My workflow in Meetyou is that the PM write requirement documents and we talk about if the case is stable and if the case can be excuted . and evaluate the day of finishing the task.
And then the UI designer will draw the PSD , and I will talk with back end engineer the structure of data that they transfer to me.
And I will start to develop.

What I learn in MeiYou is that I can solve a problem bymyself.
Maybe in the colleage, when i meet with a problem ,the first thing i do is ask someone for help .
But now ,I can solve a problem by console.log or debugger .
And my way of programming is from process-oriented to object-oriented.
And I love the process of solving a problem and it makes me be proud of myself.

I really want to be a part of your campany , and If you hire me , i will never make you disapointed.

My advantage is that I am a girl who has patience.If I am interested in something, I would like to spend my time to study.

Skill 1: Solving Problems
learn to solve problems is very important.
Without problems there wouldn’t be a need for software.
All software is designed to solve some user problem .


Skill 2: Teaching Yourself
There is probably no more important skill in life than learning to learn.
This skill is especially important in software development.
you need the ability to quickly acquire the knowledge you need for the task at hand.
If you truly want to have a skill that will propel you through your software development career, learn how to teach yourself.
The only way to develop this skill is to put it into use.  
If I can quickly adapt to the rapidly changing software development market and technologies and platforms associated with it, I will have skills that will always be in demand.

Skill 4: Dealing with People
Learn to how to deal with people is very important.
Everywhere I go there are people.
Unless I work alone and develop software just for myself, other people are going to influence my career as a software developer.
The basic problem is that humans are not logical creatures, we are emotional ones.
Being active and involved in the software development community in general can also help me in my career.
